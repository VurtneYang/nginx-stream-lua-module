Based on nginx-1.4.1, refer to nginx-http-lua(https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module), tcp_lua(https://github.com/bigplum/nginx-tcp-lua-module),
based on principles of simple, efficient and highly extensible, the nginx-tcp module is designed as a customized stream protocol server, more than http, mail server.
And the ngx_tcp_lua module is very useful in fast implement your own service.

1. Patch log.c, ngx_http_log_module, add the command `nlog`,`access_nlog` to send error_log,access_log to log server.
2. tcp_module for customized stream protocol on tcp, support ssl.
    example, tcp/ngx_tcp_demo_module. 
3. tcp_lua module: embeds Lua code, 100% non-blocking on network traffic.
    3.1 just like ngx_tcp_demo_module, ngx_tcp_lua module is a special module on tcp_module.
    3.2 enriched the functions such as init_by_lua,ngx.sleep,ngx.exit, just like nginx-lua-module
    3.3 lua lib with cosocket to deal with mysql,http server. simple load banlance and retry also supported
    3.4 support ngx.nlog to send log to udp log server, more than ngx.log to local file.
    3.5 support ssl cosocket with upstream
4. About installation, APIs, and examples, see tcp/doc/ for more details
